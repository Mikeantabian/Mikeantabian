# Michael Antabian

👋 Greetings! I'm Michael Antabian, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering. 🎓 My academic focus includes computer architecture, hardware coding, embedded systems, and digital signals and systems.

💻 I enjoy working with microcontrollers and FPGAs to bring my projects to life. It's the thrill of creating something tangible from scratch that keeps me hooked on this journey.

🛠️ Proficient in various programming languages, I'm navigating the final year of my undergraduate studies with a passion for making meaningful contributions to the tech space.

🏋️ Outside the coding arena, you'll find me lifting weights in the gym, exploring new languages, diving into a good book, and cherishing moments with friends and family.
